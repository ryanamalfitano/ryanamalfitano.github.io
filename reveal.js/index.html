                        Hey everyone, welcome to my presentation on the Plus Four Routefinder. The Routefinder is a pretty unique and interesting piece of technology,
                        even by today's standards. I'm going to be explaining what this thing is, how it works, and what influence it might have had on some similar
                        technologies that we know today.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        So first of all, what is the Routefinder? This is an image of what it looked like. It's a wrist-mounted navigation device made in the 1920's that
                        you would load up with these map scrolls, and manually scroll them with the knobs on the side as you were driving down the road, following the
                        route on the map.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        These scrolls would show the route you should take to get from where you are to your destination - using highway and road numbers, city names,
                        and other landmarks to guide you on your way even if you're unfamiliar with the area. There were apparently many scrolls for many routes and
                        destinations when this thing existed.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        This was a pretty interesting invention for its time - even though it was manually operated, it was the first device of its kind to try and
                        automate navigation and pathfinding to some degree, as it showed the driver a map and planned out their route, so they could concentrate
                        on driving and wouldn't have to plan out a route themselves or ask locals for directions the whole way.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Now, I know what you're thinking - why aren't we all using Routefinders every day? Well, there are some pretty obvious flaws with this thing
                        even at first glance. It might have been somewhat useful at the time, but it really just feels too gimmicky, and is only useful when you're
                        driving. Plus, you could just use a regular map and not be at much of a loss.

                <section><!-- Slide 6 -->
                    <img src="img/iterauto1.jpg" alt="Iter Auto Image" />
                    <aside class="notes">
                        But, the Routefinder actually did inspire another early navigation tech around 1932 by the name of the Iter Auto: it operated on the same concept
                        as the Routefinder, but was mounted directly into your car, and used a contraption similar to a modern speedometer to scroll the map
                        automatically based on your speed.
                    </aside>
                </section>
                
                <section><!-- Slide 7 -->
                    <img src="img/iterauto2.jpg" alt="Iter Auto Image" />
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The Iter Auto also used map scrolls like the Routefinder, but it seems like it was focused on day-to-day navigation, rather than providing
                        routes for longer trips like the Routefinder did. I couldn't find out how to change map scrolls in the Iter Auto, but you might've had to
                        after every single turn, which would get old pretty fast.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        So even though the Routefinder and the Iter Auto didn't really catch on, I'm sure you can see some similarities between them and the modern GPS
                        and mapping technology we have today. These gadgets were like maps on your smartphone or dashboard navigation systems, only eighty or so years
                        earlier than the systems we rely on now.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        This is pretty interesting, as the first online mapping service to really become popular was MapQuest, and it didn't even exist until 1996,
                        taking a few years to really become well-known. Google Maps then began to take over and released Google Maps for Mobile in 2005, eighty five
                        years after the Routefinder was made.

                    <img src="img/dair.jpg" alt="GM's DAIR System" />
                    <aside class="notes">
                        As for vehicle-based navigation systems, like the Iter Auto, GM worked on a system in 1966 to allow drivers to contact a service center and get
                        assistance. There were a lot of ambitious features planned for this system known as DAIR, but it never saw the light of day. It actually came
                        back in another form as OnStar.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        So, what would the Routefinder look like if it wasn't left on the side of the road and actually became popular? New models may have been created,
                        with more capabilities, such as the ability to load multiple maps at once and switch between them quickly, to make it less annoying to switch them.
                        It could also somehow measure speed so you didn't have to scroll the map manually.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        This updated Routefinder might've gone on to pioneer more early navigation technologies, and could've caused mapping services like MapQuest or
                        Google Maps to have been structured differently to take after the Routefinder's functionality, setting itself as the standard for the navigation
                        devices and mapping services that came about later on.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Another interesting fact about the Routefinder is that a concept very similar to the Iter Auto was patented by one John Bovy in 1921, but the
                        Routefinder itself was built within the next few years, building off the idea - then, the Iter Auto wasn't released until 1932, a decade after
                        the patent was claimed for an almost identical concept.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        So to wrap up, the Routefinder was an early concept for a portable mapping and navigation system intended to make it easier for drivers to find
                        routes to get from point A to point B, which was later also explored in the sibling device, the Iter Auto, which used a similar concept, but was
                        mounted onto the dashboard of the vehicle.
