            <p>Hi, I'm Ryan Amalfitano, a current student at Brock University in St. Catharines, and I'm in my second year of the Interactive Arts and Sciences (IASC) program, which has strong links to the Digital Humanities (DH). The research specialization within DH that I find most interesting is text analysis and data visualization: a project within these fields that I would consider taking part in might be something like the Z-Axis Tool; some kind of text analysis and data visualization tool which can display and represent text analysis and research results in an interesting and coherent way. Some of my existing projects have already included results from text analyses and data visualizations, including my Academic Blog, in which I used the tool Voyant to find the most commonly used words in texts, which supported the argument I made within that project. In the future, I may take my work in other directions, such as perhaps combining text analysis and data visualization with geospatial analysis, to link specific words and terms to the corresponding geographical locations that they refer to or are linked to (again, like Z-Axis â€“ where a text was taking place when a certain word is used), and include that within the visualization.</p>
